# JavaScript Data Types: Primitive vs Reference

In JavaScript, data types are divided into two main categories: 📂📝

- **Primitive Data Types**
- **Reference (Non-Primitive) Data Types**

Understanding the difference between these two categories is fundamental to mastering JavaScript behavior, especially in memory management, equality comparison, and mutation.

## 1. Primitive Data Types 🧮🔢

Primitive data types are **immutable** and **stored by value**. This means that when you assign or copy a primitive value, a new copy is created.

### Types of Primitive Data Types:

1. **Number**

   - Represents both integer and floating-point numbers.
   - Example:

     ```js
     let age = 25;
     let price = 99.99;
     ```

2. **String**

   - Represents a sequence of characters.
   - Example:

     ```js
     let name = "Akash";
     ```

3. **Boolean**

   - Represents a logical value: `true` or `false`.
   - Example:

     ```js
     let isActive = true;
     ```

4. **Undefined**

   - A variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
   - Example:

     ```js
     let score;
     console.log(score); // undefined
     ```

5. **Null**

   - Represents the intentional absence of any value.
   - Example:

     ```js
     let user = null;
     ```

6. **Symbol (ES6)**

   - Used to create unique identifiers for object properties.
   - Example:

     ```js
     const id = Symbol("id");
     ```

7. **BigInt (ES2020)**

   - Used to represent integers of arbitrary length.
   - Example:

     ```js
     const bigNumber = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;
     ```

### Characteristics of Primitive Types: ⚙️📌🧩

- Stored directly in the **stack**.
- Compared by **value**.
- Immutable: You cannot change the value directly.

### Example:

```js
let a = 10;
let b = a;
b = 20;
console.log(a); // 10 (remains unchanged)
```

## 2. Reference Data Types 🗂️🏷️

Reference types are **mutable** and **stored by reference**. When you assign or copy a reference type, you're copying the reference (address), not the actual value.

### Types of Reference Data Types:

1. **Object**

   - A collection of key-value pairs.
   - Example:

     ```js
     const person = { name: "Akash", age: 25 };
     ```

2. **Array** (a type of object)

   - An ordered list of values.
   - Example:

     ```js
     const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
     ```

3. **Function** (a callable object)

   - Example:

     ```js
     function greet() {
       console.log("Hello");
     }
     ```

### Characteristics of Reference Types: 🔁🔍

- Stored in the **heap**, with a reference (address) on the **stack**.
- Compared by **reference**, not by value.
- Mutable: Changes made to one reference affect all references.

### Example:

```js
const obj1 = { name: "Akash" };
const obj2 = obj1;
obj2.name = "Rahul";
console.log(obj1.name); // "Rahul" (both point to the same object)
```

## 3. Key Differences 📝📚

| Feature          | Primitive                     | Reference                    |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Stored in        | Stack                         | Heap (referenced from stack) |
| Comparison       | By value                      | By reference                 |
| Mutability       | Immutable                     | Mutable                      |
| Examples         | Number, String, Boolean, etc. | Object, Array, Function      |
| Copying behavior | Creates a new copy            | Copies the reference         |

## 4. Equality Comparison 🤝🆚

```js
// Primitive
let x = 5;
let y = 5;
console.log(x === y); // true (same value)

// Reference
let objA = { val: 10 };
let objB = { val: 10 };
console.log(objA === objB); // false (different references)

let objC = objA;
console.log(objA === objC); // true (same reference)
```

---

## 5. Copying Techniques ✂️📋

### For Primitive:

```js
let a = 10;
let b = a; // copy
```

### For Reference:

#### Shallow Copy

```js
const original = { name: "Akash" };
const copy = { ...original };
```

#### Deep Copy (using JSON)

```js
const deepCopy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(original));
```

## Conclusion 🧾🔚

- Understanding the difference between primitive and reference types is critical for debugging and writing efficient code.
- Remember: primitives are copied **by value**, reference types are copied **by reference**.
- Always be cautious when copying or comparing reference types.
