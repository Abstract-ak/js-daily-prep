# Null vs. Not Defined vs. Undefined in JavaScript

In JavaScript, understanding the differences between `null`, `undefined`, and "not defined" is crucial for avoiding subtle bugs and ensuring robust code. Here‚Äôs a deep dive into these three concepts.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ `undefined`

### What is it?

- **`undefined`** is a primitive value automatically assigned to variables that have been declared but not assigned a value.
- It also represents the absence of a value when accessing a property that doesn‚Äôt exist on an object, or when a function returns nothing.

### How is it assigned?

- **Implicitly:**
  ```javascript
  let x;
  console.log(x); // undefined
  ```

````

* **Explicitly:**

  ```javascript
  let y = undefined;
  ```

### Common scenarios

‚úÖ Declared but not assigned:

```javascript
let a;
console.log(a); // undefined
```

‚úÖ Function with no return statement:

```javascript
function doNothing() {}
console.log(doNothing()); // undefined
```

‚úÖ Accessing non-existent object property:

```javascript
const obj = { name: 'Alice' };
console.log(obj.age); // undefined
```

‚úÖ Array elements that do not exist:

```javascript
const arr = [10];
console.log(arr[1]); // undefined
```

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ `null`

### What is it?

* **`null`** is a primitive value that represents the intentional absence of any object value.
* It must be explicitly assigned by the developer.

### Use cases

‚úÖ Resetting or clearing variables:

```javascript
let selectedItem = { id: 1, name: 'Pen' };
// User clears selection
selectedItem = null;
```

‚úÖ Indicating no value for an object property:

```javascript
const user = {
  name: 'Bob',
  address: null // no address
};
```

### Important points

* `typeof null` is `"object"`, which is a historical bug in JavaScript.
* Use `null` when you want to indicate that a variable should have no value.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ `not defined`

### What is it?

* **`not defined`** occurs when you try to access a variable that has never been declared.
* Unlike `undefined` (a runtime value), this is a **ReferenceError** at runtime.

### Example

```javascript
console.log(xyz); // ReferenceError: xyz is not defined
```

### Key takeaway

* Variables must be **declared** (with `var`, `let`, or `const`) before being used.
* If not declared at all, they are truly "not defined" and throw an error when accessed.

## Summary Table

| State         | Example                            | typeof         |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------- |
| `undefined`   | `let x; console.log(x);`           | `"undefined"`  |
| `null`        | `let y = null;`                    | `"object"`     |
| `not defined` | `console.log(z);` (`z` undeclared) | ReferenceError |

## Practical Examples and Differences

```javascript
let a;
console.log(a); // undefined

let b = null;
console.log(b); // null

console.log(c); // ReferenceError: c is not defined
```

### Checking for `undefined` vs. `null`

```javascript
let data = null;
if (data === null) {
  console.log('It is explicitly null!');
}

let info;
if (info === undefined) {
  console.log('It is undefined!');
}
```

### Loose vs. strict equality

```javascript
console.log(null == undefined);  // true (loose equality)
console.log(null === undefined); // false (strict equality)
```

## Best Practices

‚úÖ Use `null` for intentional absence of value.
‚úÖ `undefined` is generally handled by JavaScript.
‚úÖ Avoid referencing variables before declaring them to prevent "not defined" errors.

---

**üí° Conclusion:**

* `undefined`: variable declared but not assigned, default for missing properties, return from functions without explicit return.
* `null`: explicit assignment to represent no value.
* `not defined`: variable never declared ‚Äì throws a ReferenceError.
